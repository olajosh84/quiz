# Quiz App

This is a simple application that shows a list of 10 general knowledge questions with a timer. These questions are randomly-generated each time the button on the home page is clicked or the quiz page is refreshed. Upon submit or expiration of the timer, a thank you message with a confetti is displayed. To view this app, please visit https://olajeksquiz.netlify.app

## Suggested Improvements

You are welcome to extend the functionality of the application. Areas I can suggest include getting the questions from an API, creating sign up and login functionality and so on.
